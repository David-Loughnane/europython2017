Coverage
I want to know the % of code my tests cover

py.test -svv cov=tdd --cov-report=term-missing

fixture - a bunch of data that is the same all over the tests, don't want to repeat, pass as parameter to test

within the repo there are test commits, then code commits that pass to tests (on master branch)

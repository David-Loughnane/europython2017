non-uniform memory architecture and cache
computer memory design used in multiprocessing, where the memory access time depends on the memory location relative to the processor
a processor can access its own local memory faster than non-local memory (memory local to another porcessor or memory shared between processors)


message passing
	mpi4py, dask
general parallelism
	multiporcessing, dask
multi-format parallelism
	cython, numba
	tbb, openMP are backends/runtimes
	numexpr, numpy, etc.



distributed computing landscape
mpi4py (message passing interface), pyspark, dask

dask = framework that uses distributed futures to construct task graphs and execute via a scheduler
specalised for computational workloads (numerical python parallelism - numpy ecosystem)
scale up aand down quickly
penalties to pay - maybe ok with single run high workload
